# Cogs-118B-Final-Project
Introduction and Motivation -- What were you trying to do and WHY?
  - For full points clearly state the problem and why it is important.

Predicting the popularity of mobile strategy games using supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms

    
Goal: To help app developers understand their target market and design better mobile games

Related work -- Mention any related work from our class readings.
For full credit also mention a recent paper in the literature that addresses this problem
(or if there is nothing like it in the literature make the case for why your problem is unique).

Methods - What did you do?  Be as precise as you can.   For full credit there should be enough detail for someone relatively skilled to replicate your work.

    1.Logistic regression
    2.Random forest
    3.K-means
    4.SVM

Results - What did you discover? How well did it work?  As this is a class project, it is likely that many things did not work as well as planned.  For this project, detailing what went wrong is as important as describing what went well.

Discussion - What did you learn?  What could you do better? (What would you
have done next if you had more time)?.....  Why do you think it didn't work if it didn't?  
If everything worked perfectly,  what next steps would you suggest for followup work.  For full credit discuss two extensions or improvements to your project with short justifications for why you think that would work better (improvements) or why they are promising extensions.
